This folder contains scripts relating to post GWAS analyses utilizing the LDSC command line tools provided by Brendan Bulik-Sullivan & Hilary Finucane (https://github.com/bulik/ldsc).

These scripts assume you already have set up a python environment and have configured this environment and Anaconda to be used correctly on Nibbler. The steps to perfom this can be found in the Nibbler HPC documentation (https://docs.gcc.rug.nl/nibbler/)
Further explanation on obtaining the LDSC github clone on the cluster you can follow the steps described in the LDSC github, as long as your virtual environments are correctly configured.
